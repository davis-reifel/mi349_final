            I assume the role of 'CFO' for Koucar Managements start-up marketing firm,
            Element 22 Media Group. As CFO I handle the accounting and financials
            for possible acquisitions; however, I also work with customers on strategy, design,
            and build.

        <p>
            As Element 22 Media Group grows, one day I hope to step down as CFO
            and become a deal maker analyzing possible mergers and acquisitions
            for Koucar Management.
